NAME
    CSS::Orientation - Perl extension to change text orientation in CSS

SYNOPSIS
      use CSS::Orientation qw( ChangeLeftToRightToLeft );
      ...
      $rtlcss = ChangeLeftToRightToLeft( $css );
      ...
      # or without imports
      $rtlcss = CSS::Orientation->change( $css );

DESCRIPTION
    This module flips CSS from LTR to an RTL orienation and vice-versa. It
    is a port of cssjanus to Perl to have the same functionality available
    without having to start another application.

  EXPORT
    Nothing by default.

   ChangeLeftToRightToLeft( \@lines | $line [ swap_ltr_rtl_in_url swap_left_right_in_url ] )
  METHODS
    To use it without import or after require:

   change( \@lines | $line [ swap_ltr_rtl_in_url swap_left_right_in_url ] )
